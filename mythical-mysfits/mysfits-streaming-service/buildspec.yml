# A buildspec.yml file informs AWS CodeBuild of all the actions that should be
# taken during a build execution for our application. We are able to divide the
# build execution in separate pre-defined phases for logical organization, and
# list the commands that will be executed on the provisioned build server
# performing a build execution job.
